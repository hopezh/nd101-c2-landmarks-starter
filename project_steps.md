# Project Steps

The high level steps of the project include:

1. Create a **_CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch)_**

    Here, you'll visualize the dataset,

    process it for training, and then

    build a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify the landmarks.

    You'll also describe some of your decisions around data processing and how you chose your network architecture.

2. Create a **_CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning)_**

    Next, you'll investigate different pre-trained models and decide on one to use for this classification task.

    Along with training and testing this transfer-learned network, you'll explain how you arrived at the pre-trained network you chose.

3. **_Write Your Landmark Prediction Algorithm_**

    Finally, you will use your best model to create a simple interface for others to be able to use your model to find the most likely landmarks depicted in an image.

    You'll also test out your model yourself and reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of your model.

## Starter Code and Instructions

Clone the project from the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd101-c2-landmarks-starter), or use the classroom workspace on the next page. Follow the instructions in the README and jupyter notebook to complete the project.

---

## Evaluation

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the CNN project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/3117/view). Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.

## Project Submission

When you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload:

-   The `landmark.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
-   An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook.

-   Any additional images used for the project that were not supplied to you for the project. Please do not include the project data sets in the `landmark_images/` folder. (If using the project workspace, the `/data/landmark_images` directory will automatically be excluded)

Alternatively, your submission could consist of the GitHub link to your repository.
